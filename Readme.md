Library Dependencies - Keras 2.0.0, Tensorflow 1.8, python3.6.2

** If you are not able to run the code because of compatibility issues, please view the HTML file - it's generated from the ipython notebook itself **

For ease of understanding, the code is divided between 5 files. A brief description is provided below. 

helper_functions.py - Contains a few utility functions required to facilitate the process.
keras_helpers.py - Extended the functionality of Keras library functions to help us in the process.
optimizers.py - A code for the Adam Optimizer.
priors.py - An implementation of Gaussian Mixture Model prior. 
data.py - Loading the MNIST dataset and storing in the format required for the paper.

Similarly, the pre-trained model, compressed model, and sparsified_model can be found here stored in the memory as files. 

All the result diagrams/figures in the report can be found in the Figures Folder.
